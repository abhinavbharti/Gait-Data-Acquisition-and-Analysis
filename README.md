The Sensor Platforms for Gait Analysis developed in this project include Plantar pressure insole and Inertial Measurment Units.

The objective of the project is (i) Design & Development of Sensorized Insole using Force Sensitive Resistive (FSR) material for measuring Plantar Pressure data and Visualization. (ii) Joint Angle measurement using IMU sensors and Validation. (iii) Estimation of Gait Parameters.

The Demo Video gives an overview of the objectives developed in this project.
